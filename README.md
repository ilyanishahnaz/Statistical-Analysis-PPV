## Statistical Data Analysis of Vaccinees and Vaccination Centers (PPV)

In this project, 2 datasets were given mainly `ppv.csv` and `people.csv`. In `ppv.csv`, the file contains the latitute and the longitude of 100 vaccination centers' locations whereas in the `people.csv`, the file contains the latitude and the longitude locations of 1000 vaccinees. The main objective is to match each of these vaccinees to their nearest vaccination centers. After figuring the correct solution to be implemented, there are 2 tasks on how statistical analysis was to be carried out.

### First Task 
The first task is to find the difference in execution time between 2 computers. Here, the Haversine function was implemented as the main method.

### Second Task
The second task is to find the difference in execution time between 3 different methods. The 3 methods used is **Geodesic Distance**, **Haversine**, and **Pythagoras Theorem**
